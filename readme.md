#The Mauritian Adventure

I love Mauritius and Spring Boot... So I thought that I will try to write a browser game using Spring Boot, Redis,
Velocity templating engine, Bootstrap and a few other technologies.

Let's see how far it will get. Once there is something playable there, I will host it and if it is fun I may even
use some real front end technologies!
